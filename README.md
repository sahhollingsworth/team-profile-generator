# Team Profile Generator
The TeamProfile Generator is a command line application that takes in user input and generates an interactable web application for all members of any given team. Using the commandline to generate team member profiles expedites the process and allows users to leverage stanard templates for required information, by role. 

This information is then added to a template to produce a web page that makes accessing any team member's GitHub or email quick and simple.

## Summary
* WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
* The application supports 4 role types, with role-specific questions: 
  * Employee (core class, not used independently of any of the extensions)
  * Manager (extension of Employee)
  * Engineer (extension of Employee)
  * Intern (extension of Employee)

### Command Line Interface
* Upon application start via - `node index.js` - the user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
* After entering the manager's information, the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building their team.
* If the engineer option is selected, the user is prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username. After which, the user is taken back to the menu.
* If the intern option is selected, the user is prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school. After which, the user is taken back to the menu.
* When the user finishes building their team and exits the application, the Team Profile Page HTML is generated with all team members.

### Web Page 
* Email addresses in the Team Page web interface are visibly clickable and open the default email program of the user to populate the "TO" field of the email with the email address.
* GitHub usernames in the Team Page web interface are visibly clickable and open the GitHub profile in a new tab in the browser.
